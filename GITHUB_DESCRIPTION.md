🎭 Maze Myth – A dynamic API honeypot that psychologically traps attackers in an ever-changing maze of deception.

## Elevator Pitch (30 seconds)

Traditional honeypots get fingerprinted in seconds. Maze Myth is different—it's a dynamic API deception maze powered by AI that generates unique paths for each attacker. They think they're winning with successful logins and data exfiltration, but every step is designed deception. By the time they realize it's fake, we've already captured their techniques, tools, and IPs. **They're trapped not by walls, but by hope.**
